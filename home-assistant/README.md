## OCPP Integration Setup (Optional)

> **Note:** This section is only for owners with OCPP-compatible home chargers (e.g., Wallbox, Grizzl-E, OpenEVSE). Skip this entire section if you don't have an OCPP charger.

**[Complete OCPP Setup Guide](ocpp-setup/README.md)**

**Quick Links:**
- [OCPP Integration Repository](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp)
- [OCPP Wiki (charger-specific guides)](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp/wiki)
- [HACS Installation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download)

### OCPP Installation

#### 1. Add Configuration

Copy the contents of `configuration/ocpp_sensors.yaml` to your `configuration.yaml`, or use include:

```yaml
# In configuration.yaml
template: !include configuration/ocpp_sensors.yaml
```

**Important:** Update entity names to match your setup:
- `sensor.your_vehicle_name_odometer` → `sensor.YOUR_VEHICLE_NAME_odometer`
- `sensor.charger_*` → your OCPP charger entity names

#### 2. Add Automations

Copy files from `automations/` to your Home Assistant automations folder.

#### 3. Import Dashboard

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**
2. Click **Add Dashboard** → **New dashboard from scratch**
3. Click the three dots → **Edit Dashboard** → **Raw configuration editor**
4. Paste contents of `dashboards/vinfast_dashboard.yaml`
5. Save

#### 4. Customize Settings

Edit these values in `configuration/ocpp_sensors.yaml`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `electricity_rate` | 0.14601 | Your $/kWh rate |
| `gas_price_per_gallon` | 3.25 | Current gas price |
| `comparable_vehicle_mpg` | 25 | Gas car comparison MPG |
| `ev_efficiency_mi_per_kwh` | 3.5 | Your VF8/VF9 efficiency |

## Dashboard Features

### Control Panel (New!)
A comprehensive web-based control panel for managing your integration:
- Monitor connection status and update intervals
- Configure polling intervals (normal and charging)
- Control OCPP charger (start/stop, availability, max current)
- Control climate (if remote control is paired)
- View vehicle information at a glance
- Trigger manual data refreshes

**Two versions available:**
- **Standalone HTML** - Works in any browser, uses HA API tokens
- **Home Assistant Dashboard** - Native HA integration, no tokens needed

**[View Control Panel Setup Guide](dashboards/CONTROL_PANEL_README.md)**

### Wall Panel Dashboard (Recommended)
A beautiful glassmorphism-style dashboard for Nest Hub and tablet displays:
- Real-time battery, range, and charging status
- Live vehicle status (lock, plug, doors, gear)
- Multi-vehicle support (1-4 VinFasts)
- Unified map showing all vehicle locations
- Telemetry update status with manual refresh

**[View Wall Panel Setup Guide](dashboards/wall-panel/README.md)**

### OCPP Charging Dashboard (Optional)
For owners with OCPP-compatible chargers:
- Battery status with charging indicators
- OCPP charger controls (start/stop, availability, max current)
- Power, current, voltage gauges
- Session energy and cost
- Period tracking (Today/7 Days/31 Days)
- Historical graphs
- Cost metrics ($/kWh, $/mile, $/100 miles)
- Gas savings comparison

## Adjustable Settings (OCPP)

After OCPP installation, adjust these from the dashboard:

| Setting | Entity | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Gas Price | `input_number.gas_price_per_gallon` | Current gas price |
| Vehicle MPG | `input_number.comparable_vehicle_mpg` | Gas car comparison |
| EV Efficiency | `input_number.ev_efficiency_mi_per_kwh` | Your VinFast mi/kWh |

## Cost Calculations

The integration provides both **estimated** and **actual** cost calculations:

- **Estimated**: Based on energy charged × efficiency
- **Actual**: Based on real odometer data when available

Actual calculations become available after driving and will show:
- Real $/mile from your driving
- Actual Wh/mile for battery degradation tracking
- True efficiency compared to estimated

## Troubleshooting

### Sensors show "unavailable"
- Ensure VinFast integration is configured with valid credentials
- Check that entity IDs match your setup
- Verify OCPP integration is connected

### Cost calculations show 0 or wrong values
- Wait for statistics to accumulate (24-48 hours)
- Verify `sensor.charger_energy_active_import_register` is reporting
- Check that odometer entity name matches your vehicle

### Dashboard not updating
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Restart Home Assistant
- Check logs for errors
